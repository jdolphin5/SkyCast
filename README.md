In Development - Interactive Weather App

The application will fetch weather data from a public API and display it with cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility. Users can search for their city and view detailed weather forecasts, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation over the next week. Users can save preferences for push notifications and favourite cities, and compare forecasts between multiple locations.
